# project-travel-app ( Work in Progress)
Travel app that obtains a desired trip location &amp; date from the user and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs

### External APIs used

* [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/) - returns latitude and longitude for location
* [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/) - returns weather forecast for the latitude and longitude
* [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/)  - To get photo for the location

We need API keys for all the APIs mentioned above.

Once we have the api keys, create `.env` file in the root and add api keys there as shown below.


```
GEONAMES_KEY = {your key here}
WEATHERBIT_KEY = {your key here}
PIXABAY_KEY = {your key here}
```
